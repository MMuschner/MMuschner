### GREETINGS FELLOW HUMAN

My name is Michael. After I finished my apprenticeship to become an electrical engineer at the german airforce I started a second one at SUSE in NÃ¼rnberg to become a programmer and to get better with linux.
My current favourite language is go and I like to programm Arduino sketches. If it really has to be I may do some python (or even C++) but I try to avoid it. 

* I have worked on https://github.com/uyuni-project/inter-server-sync and currently I am working on https://github.com/trento-project/trento.
* Currently learning go (with a focus on web-dev), postgresql, protobuf, security
* I speak german and english (maybe soon also dutch)
* How to reach me: michael.muschner@mailbox.org

## My skills

* Linux 
* Electrical stuff and arduino
* A bit of networking
* Go
* Git 
* Postgresql
